# Movie-Review-Database
Overview
Write a program using objects to simulate a movie reviewing system.


Background
You are writing code to manage a database for movie reviews. Movies are added to the system, and
reviews are added for that movie. Then summaries of all reviews for movies can be displayed.

Program
Your program is designed to simulate a system for managing reviews for movies. This will be called the
movie database. The movie database is controlled by reading a text file that contains the commands for
the database. Reading these commands changes the state of the movie database â€“ adding movies,
adding reviews or displaying information.
Your program will create classes for both movies and movie databases. Movies will have a title, a year
of release and a collection of reviews. The movie database will contain a list of movies. Then your
program will prompt the user for a file containing a list of commands, read the list of commands, and
process the information in each command. This will produce some output, which should be shown on
the screen.
